# Create your own AMA!

- [Fork](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/fork) my AMA or copy paste its [readme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sindresorhus/ama/main/readme.md) into new repo.
- Personalize the readme with your bio, what people can ask, website/twitter/etc links.
- If you forked, you have to enable the issue tracker: `Settings` → `Features` → `☑ Issues`.
- Add it to [this list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas). *(Please read the [contributing guidelines](contributing.md)).*
- [Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ask%20me%20*anything*%20in%20my%20shiny%20new%20AMA!%20[insert%20link%20to%20your%20AMA]) about your shiny new AMA!
- When you've answered a question in your AMA, close the issue.
- **Read and ask questions in the [other AMAs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas).** *(Good way to encourage others to ask questions in your AMA)*
