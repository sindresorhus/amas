# Ask me anything!

ðŸ‘‹  I'm **Vartika**, you can call me **V** for simplicity :)

I run a community of software engineers (StackRaft) and help them get introduced with companies doing meaningful work

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20sort%3Aupdated-desc%20-label%3Ahidden)

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
