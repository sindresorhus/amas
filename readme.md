## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
